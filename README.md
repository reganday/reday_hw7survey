 BAIS:3300 - HW 7: Web Forms

This project is a form that collects information from University of Iowa Business Analytics students. It will help improve the department's offerings in future years.

This web form conforms to best practices because it can be taken and understood from anyone trying to access it. To start, the color contrast that I've used on pages makes it so anyone can see the differences in color and read it. Additionally, I have used inclusive language across the demographic portion so everyone feels comfortable and safe with my language.
The serif and sans serif fonts can easily be seen using a screen. The images also have alternative text so screen readers can understand it as well.

This form provides user accessibility for the reasons above. Everyone can take my survey because it conforms to best practices. It can be taken on a wide variety of devices and using screen readers or not. Since this is something that every student in the Department of Business Analytics will be taking, I wanted to make sure that it was accessible for everyone.
